# Server
With default configuration the server will listen on following ports:
```
80 - http/download
52100 - tcp/server
```
ensure that no other local services listen on these ports.

# Client
Launch the client with the following args:
`"DDO.exe" "addr=localhost port=52100 token=00000000000000000000 DL=http://127.0.0.1/win/ LVer=03.04.003.20181115.0 RVer=3040008"`

#Development

### Cli
Entrypoint to the application, allows to start different components via parameters
### Server
- Read / Write network packages
- Manage Connections
#### Asset
- Static Assets that can be loaded on startup
### LoginServer
- Handling of Login related packets
### GameServer
- Handling of Game related packets
### WebServer
- Handling http/https requests.
- Client version request
- Account creation API
- Login / Token retrieval API
### Database
- Persistent storage
- Supports different implementations via IDatabase interface
- SQLite concrete implementation
### Shared
Extension.cs -> Useful C# extension methods
Util.cs -> Static Utility functions
#### Crypto
Components related to cryptography, for network protocol, token generation or random oracle.
#### Csv
Reading and parsing of CSV files
#### Entity
Representing the packet structure of the network protocol, including serialization adn deserialization.
#### Model
Classes that can be used by multiple components, usually just to hold data in a structured way
### PacketLibrary
- Read pcap files (experimental)
- Read (custom) json format of packet data
- Format and annotate packets with internal packet names
### Test
- Unit test to lock in functionality


# Guidelines
## Git 
### Workflow
The work on this project should happen via `feature-branches`
   
Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. 
When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point. 
The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, 
but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).
   
1) Create a new `feature/feature-name` or `fix/bug-fix-name` branch from master
2) Push all your changes to that branch
3) Create a Pull Request to merge that branch into `master`

## Best Practise
- Do not use Console.WriteLine etc, use the specially designed logger.
- Own the Code: extract solutions, discard libraries.
- Annotate functions with documentation comments (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments).
